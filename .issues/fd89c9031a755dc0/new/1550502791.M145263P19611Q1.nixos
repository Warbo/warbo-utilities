Subject: Make trackGit generate git pages
Message-Id: <fd89c9031a755dc0-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Each repo gets a 'foo.git' directory on chriswarbo.net, but it should
also get a 'foo' directory.

We should use 'genGitHtml' to create these pages in
~/Programming/git-html, then run 'pushGitPages' to push them upstream.
