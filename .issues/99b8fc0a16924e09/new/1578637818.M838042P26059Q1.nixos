Subject: Make trackGit ask about commitizen
Message-Id: <99b8fc0a16924e09-0-artemis@nixos>

Commitizen is a convention around things like commit messages. There's
associated tooling to correctly format such messages, to generate
changelogs from such histories, etc.

We should ask if we should add the formatting stuff to our git hooks.

We should ask if we should initialise a changelog.
