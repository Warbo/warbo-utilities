Subject: Suggest tags based on path and filename

resolution: fixed

Once we have find_untagged.sh, we can start to guess values. In
particular:

 - Artist directory should be suggested as artist
 - Album directory (if any) should be suggested as album
 - Match filename against cached album tracks to get title and track
   number
 - Use MusicBrainz to get everything else
